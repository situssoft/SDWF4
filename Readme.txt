This solution will build in SD4.2 the build output will contain al the necessary files for the addin.

The addin can be loaded using the Add-In Manager, care should be taken when loading & developing to avoid file locks. 
The easiest way to develop seems to be to develop witin a development version of SD itself.

This addin will add templates for Workflow projects based on those found in Visual Studio 2010 and the ability to use the graphical
design surface. Debugging is not available in this version.
